# The Picnic Cafe 

## HTML EMAIL
Promotional email created and designed for a local eatery in Nashville, TN.

## Overview 
•Staying true to branding and the business's core values, I designed and coded the email using the companies complementary color scheme of white and blue, which provides a strong contrast. When determining the font, I chose Libre Baskerville as it embodies the business's branding and works well for reading on screen.
 
• The layout is designed to flow throughout and coded with multiple links that the user can navigate to their website, related articles, and the menu. Content and images were crafted and optimized to be approachable while using sale tactics. Embedded in the code is a dark mode feature which reduces eye strain.
